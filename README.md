# BulkRenamerProject

BulkRenamer is a Windows tool that allows you to rename multiple files at once. To use the tool, enter the current name of the file(s) and then enter the new name that will replace it. Next, choose the directory in which the files are located. There are different settings available, the most important being whether the current name refers to the entire file name or only part of the file name. Other settings include choosing the file type, deciding whether to apply renaming to only the current directory or all child directories, and including the option to rename folders with the same name.

## Warning

**Important Notice:**

While using BulkRenamer, particularly when renaming multiple files at once, please be aware of the following potential risks and precautions:

1. **File Loss or Damage**: Renaming multiple files simultaneously can potentially result in loss or damage to files if not done carefully. Always ensure you have a backup of your files before proceeding with batch renaming operations.

2. **Irreversible Changes**: Once files are renamed, the changes cannot be undone automatically by the application. Please double-check your settings and the list of files to be renamed before executing the renaming process.

3. **Special Characters and Naming Conventions**: Be cautious when using special characters and complex naming conventions. Some characters might not be processed correctly, which could lead to unexpected results.

4. **System Performance**: Processing a large number of files may affect system performance. It is recommended to perform batch operations in smaller groups if you experience any slowdowns or issues.
